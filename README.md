### Bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency that was invented in 2008 by an individual or group of individuals using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The history of Bitcoin can be traced back to a whitepaper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System," which was published by Nakamoto in October 2008. The whitepaper outlined the fundamental principles and mechanisms of the Bitcoin network.

### In January 2009, the Bitcoin software was released as open-source code, and the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain, known as the "genesis block," was mined by Nakamoto. This marked the beginning of the Bitcoin network and the creation of the first-ever bitcoins.
